## Michael Briggs Contribution Response

I am interested in this project because I like the simplicity of it, as well as the practicality of the project. 
I expect that I could have the opportunity to work with a point of sale product in my life, so I think that this would be a 
good experience for me. I like the idea of this being open source. I feel like it opens the door for a diversity of 
perspective, as well as contributing to the community of open source software. In regards to an open source license, I think 
that this is a great idea. I personally have used the MIT License in the past. Technology wise, I think the philosophy of 
keeping it simple is fantastic, and I think that using python is reflective of that desired simplicity. I appreciate that you 
have thought about the libraries that python has, as well as the dependencies we would need to use. Overall, I like the 
practicality and proposed simplicity of this project and would love to contribute however I can.
