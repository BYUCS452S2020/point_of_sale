I'd love to join this project as I'm interested in inventory management. I eventually want to build a personal inventory management system and feel like this project would be good preparation.

I also have work experience with the entire tech stack. I've used Python for a few years and am currently building a DBMS client for MongoDB at Qualtrics.

I want to work hard and complete this project quickly.
